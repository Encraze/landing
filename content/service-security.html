  <h2>Security &amp; Compliance</h2>

  <p>
    Security is not a checklist. It is a discipline that must quietly wrap every decision you make:
    architecture, code, infrastructure, vendors, people.
  </p>

  <h4>Application &amp; platform security</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li><code>threat modeling</code> for products, platforms and data flows.</li>
    <li>Secure‑by‑default <code>architecture</code> reviews of critical components and data paths.</li>
    <li>Secure SDLC: coding standards, reviews, dependency hygiene and secrets management.</li>
    <li>SAST/DAST, container and dependency scanning, and integration into CI/CD.</li>
    <li>Authentication, authorization and identity design: IAM, RBAC, least privilege.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Cloud &amp; infrastructure security</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Cloud security baselines across AWS/GCP/Azure: networks, storage, keys, logging.</li>
    <li>Secrets management, key rotation and certificate lifecycle.</li>
    <li>Network segmentation, zero‑trust patterns and exposure reduction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Compliance &amp; operational security</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>
      Controls, policies and evidence that satisfy
      <strong>ISO27001</strong>, <strong>SOC2</strong> and related frameworks.
    </li>
    <li>Vendor risk management and security reviews.</li>
    <li>Incident runbooks, escalation paths and post‑incident learning that actually sticks.</li>
    <li>Business continuity and disaster recovery design, including backup and restore drills.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We step in as the calm center between engineering, legal, risk and audit:
    translating requirements into design and work items,
    then ensuring controls live in your code, not just in documents.
