  <h2>Strategy &amp; Vision</h2>

  <p>
    Vision is cheap. Converging a whole company on a sharp, executable direction is not.
  </p>

  <h4>Defining the north star</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Clarifying technical north star and constraints with founders and leadership.</li>
    <li>Balancing ambition, regulatory reality and current capabilities.</li>
    <li>Articulating what “good” looks like in 12–36 months for product, platform and organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Making it executable</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Translating strategy into objectives, roadmaps and architecture principles.</li>
    <li>Aligning product, engineering and data so they pull in the same direction.</li>
    <li>Portfolio of bets: what we do now, what we deliberately postpone, what we never do.</li>
    <li>Build vs buy decisions, and when to invest in platform work vs features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Governance without bureaucracy</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Decision‑making and governance that prevent “initiative sprawl”.</li>
    <li>Technical due diligence support (fundraising, M&amp;A, vendor selection).</li>
    <li>Rhythms for strategy review so you can adapt without thrashing the organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We help you see the whole system, name the few things that truly matter,
    and then wire every layer &mdash; people, process, technology &mdash; around that intent.
