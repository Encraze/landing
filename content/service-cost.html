  <h2>Operational Expenses</h2>

  <p>
    Cost is a signal. Either it reflects deliberate investment, or it reveals chaos.
  </p>

  <h4>FinOps foundations</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Full cloud cost review: compute, storage, networking, data transfer, licenses.</li>
    <li>Tagging and account structure so cost signals are trustworthy.</li>
    <li>Unit economics: cost per customer, transaction, request or feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Structural optimization</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Architecture and infra changes that remove structural waste, not just “turn things off”.</li>
    <li>Rightsizing, autoscaling policies, reserved instances / savings plans.</li>
    <li>Storage lifecycle, data egress management and region selection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Controls and visibility</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Budgets, alerts and dashboards that make spend visible to the right people.</li>
    <li>Guardrails and policies that prevent surprise bills and runaway experiments.</li>
    <li>Partnering finance and engineering so unit economics are understood and owned.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not optimize for the cheapest possible system.
    We optimize for the system that gives you the most leverage per dollar, sustainably.
