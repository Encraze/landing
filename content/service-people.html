  <h2>People &amp; Leadership</h2>
  <p>
    Great systems are built by great teams. Great teams do not happen by accident.
  </p>

  <h4>Hiring and team formation</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Org and role design: which teams you actually need, how they interact, and why.</li>
    <li>Hiring frameworks and interview loops for backend, frontend, data, ML, SRE, product and leadership.</li>
    <li>Scorecards and rubrics that make “what good looks like” explicit for each role.</li>
    <li>Onboarding flows so new people become effective in weeks, not months.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Growth, feedback and performance</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Competency / skill matrices per track (IC, manager, architect, TPM, etc.).</li>
    <li>Growth paths and promotion criteria that are transparent and credible.</li>
    <li>1:1 structures, feedback loops, peer review and recognition that encourage learning.</li>
    <li>Performance management that is fair, data‑informed and human &mdash; including PIPs when needed.</li>
    <li>Companion structures for remote / hybrid teams, including communication and collaboration norms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Leadership coaching</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Coaching for tech leads, managers and heads of engineering stepping into bigger scope.</li>
    <li>Decision‑making frameworks, delegation and ownership boundaries for leaders.</li>
    <li>Conflict resolution and escalation patterns that do not poison the culture.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We help you build an organization where people know what good looks like,
    how to grow towards it, and how to make decisions without waiting for a hero.
