  <h2>Performance &amp; Scalability</h2>
  <p>
    Fast is a feature. Predictable is survival.
  </p>

  <h4>Finding the bottlenecks</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>End‑to‑end latency and throughput analysis &mdash; from browser or mobile app to database.</li>
    <li>Profiling of hot paths: CPU, memory, I/O, database queries, external calls.</li>
    <li>Slow query analysis, indexing strategies and schema tuning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Designing for scale</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Capacity planning, load testing and SLO design for realistic growth curves.</li>
    <li>Performance‑oriented architectures: caching, queues, back‑pressure, fan‑out / fan‑in.</li>
    <li>Event‑driven vs synchronous flows, batch vs streaming decisions.</li>
    <li>Frontend performance: bundling, caching, CDNs and perceived‑latency improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Making performance a habit</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Observability that exposes reality: metrics, traces, logging and meaningful dashboards.</li>
    <li>Performance budgets and guardrails integrated into CI/CD.</li>
    <li>Turning performance work into a continuous habit, not a one‑off “war room”.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We reveal where time and resources are really spent, then carve a path to systems
    that stay fast when your user base and data volumes are no longer “reasonable”.
