  <h2>Stability &amp; High Availability</h2>
  <p>
    Outages are expensive, but living in permanent firefighting mode is worse.
  </p>

  <h4>Designing resilient systems</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Design and review for resilience: redundancy, graceful degradation, failure domains.</li>
    <li>Multi‑AZ / multi‑region strategies, data replication and failover.</li>
    <li>Backup and restore design, and actually testing restores under pressure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>SRE &amp; incident management</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>SLO / SLA definitions that reflect real customer expectations and error budgets.</li>
    <li>Incident response playbooks, on‑call rotations and communication patterns.</li>
    <li>Game days and chaos‑style exercises that expose weak spots before production does.</li>
    <li>Post‑incident analysis that fixes <em>systems</em>, not just symptoms or individuals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We stabilize the platform and the way teams respond to failure,
    so “keeping the lights on” stops consuming all of your creative energy.
