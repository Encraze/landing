  <h2>Cloud &amp; Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>
    Your platform is the canvas on which everything else is painted.
    If the canvas is brittle or expensive, nothing on top will feel right.
  </p>

  <h4>Cloud &amp; platform architecture</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Cloud architecture across AWS, GCP, Azure and hybrid environments.</li>
    <li>Kubernetes, serverless and container platforms that are understandable and operable.</li>
    <li>Multi‑tenant vs single‑tenant trade‑offs, isolation and blast‑radius control.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Data &amp; observability</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Data store selection and design: SQL, NoSQL, streams, analytics and warehousing.</li>
    <li>Backup, retention and lifecycle management for data at rest.</li>
    <li>Observability stack: metrics, logs, traces, alerting and SLOs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Automation &amp; access</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>CI/CD, IaC (Terraform, etc.) and GitOps practices that keep environments consistent.</li>
    <li>Security, networking and identity (IAM) woven into the design from the beginning.</li>
    <li>Secrets and configuration management (Vault, cloud KMS/SM, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We shape infrastructure that supports your ambitions instead of constantly limiting them,
    while keeping operational complexity as low as your situation allows.
