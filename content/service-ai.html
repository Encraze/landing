  <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

  <p>
    AI is neither magic nor a fad. Used well, it is force‑multiplication.
    Used poorly, it is expensive chaos and compliance risk.
  </p>

  <h4>Where we apply AI</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Identifying high‑leverage AI opportunities in your products and internal workflows.</li>
    <li>Designing LLM‑powered features, agents and tools with clear boundaries and fallbacks.</li>
    <li>Building retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) and semantic search on top of your data.</li>
    <li>Classic machine learning (tabular / time‑series) for prediction, ranking and scoring.</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing: classification, extraction, summarization, translation, NER.</li>
    <li>Computer vision pipelines where needed (document understanding, image classification, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How we deliver it safely</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Choosing between off‑the‑shelf APIs, fine‑tuned models and bespoke deployments.</li>
    <li>Data, privacy and compliance posture for AI usage (PII, PHI, trade secrets, regulations).</li>
    <li>Evaluation frameworks for AI quality: golden sets, human‑in‑the‑loop review, A/B tests.</li>
    <li>MLOps: experiment tracking, model registry, CI/CD for models, monitoring and rollback.</li>
    <li>Monitoring quality, drift and cost so AI features stay trustworthy over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We help you move from “we should do something with AI” to concrete capabilities
    that your teams can understand, operate and evolve safely.
