  <h2>Processes &amp; Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    Process is not bureaucracy. It is the shape that lets your team move fast without tearing itself apart.
  </p>

  <h4>SDLC &amp; planning</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Designing SDLC that matches your risk and pace &mdash; not copying someone else’s playbook.</li>
    <li>Scrum, Kanban or hybrid setups tuned to your team size and product maturity.</li>
    <li>Backlog design, refinement and estimation that keep work small and meaningful.</li>
    <li>Discovery/delivery balance: how product discovery fits with engineering execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Execution and change management</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Team topologies and ownership boundaries that reduce cross‑team friction.</li>
    <li>Release and change‑management flows (feature flags, canary, blue‑green, rollback).</li>
    <li>Risk management and dependency mapping across teams and programs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Measuring the flow</h4>
  <ul class="command-list">
    <li>Metrics that track flow, not just outputs: lead time, cycle time, failure rates, recovery.</li>
    <li>Value stream mapping and bottleneck analysis.</li>
    <li>Connecting delivery metrics to business outcomes and OKRs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We tune your delivery engine so that ideas become reality in a predictable, humane way,
    with fewer late surprises and far less “hero mode”.
